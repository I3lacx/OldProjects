This is an unorganized repository

So here is a quick summary of what is in there:
- a NN build from scratch 
- a very simple NN using mostly documentary code from tensorflow
- a TicTacToe AI using a NN (can't remember if and how it works, but i guess it didn't work)
- a programm that produces random rectangles in all shapes and sizes (even with color mode) using opencv

What is not in there:
- Code from Tutorials I have followed where most of the code is mostly from other sources
- as example: "Object Detection using tensorflow" from sentdex
